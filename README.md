Hello World!
I've have one problem now - while orks launch rockets at Kyiv I often forgot to turn off lights or PC.
So I thought it would be good idea to create home assistant to allow auto-turn off or from web.

Here is things I think would be cool to implement here:
 + Human detection in room
 + Auto-switch light and power-sockets
 + Videofeed to look after grand-dad
 + Telemetry, such as temperature, humidity, power usage
 + Voice recognizion, as input

Any help I would appresiate, as well as any donations on Armed Ukrainian Forces, or to any ukrainian volunteer.

Слава Україні!
